<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
As we use the Internet and digital devices more and more, risks also increase. It is not enough to know the basics: it is important to learn more advanced computer security concepts, even as a beginner. In this guide you will learn how to better protect yourself, with clear and practical explanations.
</p>

<h2>Why is computer security important?</h2>
<p>
Computer security protects your personal information, your accounts, your files and your digital identity. A security failure can cause anything from losing photos to money theft or identity impersonation.
</p>

<h2>Most common types of threats</h2>
<ul>
<li>Malware: programs designed to damage or spy</li>
<li>Phishing: tricks to steal data</li>
<li>Ransomware: blocks your system and asks for ransom</li>
<li>Spyware: spies on your activity</li>
<li>Keyloggers: record what you type</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is phishing?</h2>
<p>
Phishing is a technique in which attackers impersonate real companies to trick you into giving away passwords or banking data. They usually arrive by email, SMS or social network messages.
</p>

<h2>How to detect a phishing attempt</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spelling mistakes</li>
<li>Suspicious links</li>
<li>Urgent messages</li>
<li>Requests for personal data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Secure passwords and password managers</h2>
<p>
A secure password must be long, complex and unique for each service. Password managers allow you to store all your passwords securely.
</p>

<h2>Two-factor authentication</h2>
<p>
Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security: in addition to the password, you need an additional code sent to your phone or email.
</p>

<h2>Updates: your best defense</h2>
<p>
Keeping the operating system and programs up to date fixes security flaws and prevents known attacks.
</p>

<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>
Making backups allows you to recover your information in case of failure, virus or accident.
</p>

<h2>Wi-Fi networks and security</h2>
<p>
Avoid performing sensitive operations on public networks. If you use them, use a VPN for greater security.
</p>

<h2>What is a VPN?</h2>
<p>
A VPN creates a secure and encrypted connection between your device and the Internet, protecting your information.
</p>

<h2>Protection on social networks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not share personal data</li>
<li>Set privacy correctly</li>
<li>Do not trust unknown profiles</li>
</ul>

<h2>The importance of digital common sense</h2>
<p>
Many threats are avoided with something very simple: thinking before clicking, downloading or replying.
</p>

<h2>Common mistakes you should avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using the same password for everything</li>
<li>Not having antivirus</li>
<li>Ignoring updates</li>
<li>Trusting any link</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security on mobile devices</h2>
<p>
Mobile phones also need protection: screen lock, updates and permission control.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Advanced computer security is not only for experts. With good practices, anyone can protect themselves effectively. Investing time in learning digital security is investing in peace of mind.
