<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Internet has become an essential tool in our daily lives. We use it to learn, communicate, work, shop and entertain ourselves. However, many people use it without really understanding what the Internet is or how it works. In this guide you will discover it step by step, with clear words and simple examples.
</p>

<h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
<p>
The Internet is a huge global network that connects millions of computers, mobile phones, tablets and other electronic devices. Thanks to this network, devices can exchange information quickly, even if they are in different countries.
</p>
<p>
When you visit a website, you send a request to another computer, called a server, which is located somewhere in the world. That server responds by sending you data: text, images, videos or sounds. All this happens in a matter of seconds.
</p>

<h2>What is the Internet used for?</h2>
<p>
The Internet is used for many things. Some of the most important are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching for information on any topic</li>
<li>Studying online</li>
<li>Sending emails</li>
<li>Talking to other people by video call</li>
<li>Working remotely</li>
<li>Buying products and services</li>
<li>Watching movies and listening to music</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thanks to the Internet, today we can access libraries, universities and courses from all over the world without leaving home.
</p>

<h2>How does the Internet work?</h2>
<p>
The Internet works thanks to a large infrastructure made up of cables, routers, satellites, servers and data centers. Most information travels through fiber optic cables that cross oceans and continents.
</p>
<p>
When you type a web address, your device looks for where that site is located and connects to the server that hosts it. The server sends the information back to your device, which displays it on your screen.
</p>

<h2>What is a website?</h2>
<p>
A website is a set of information accessible through the Internet. It can contain text, images, videos, links and forms. Many web pages together form a website.
</p>
<p>
Examples of websites are Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, social networks or online stores.
</p>

<h2>What is a browser?</h2>
<p>
A browser is a program that allows access to the Internet and viewing web pages. Some well-known browsers are Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox or Safari.
</p>
<p>
Without a browser, you could not “see” the Internet, even if you are connected to it.
</p>

<h2>Advantages of the Internet</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fast access to information</li>
<li>Instant communication</li>
<li>Learning opportunities</li>
<li>Ease of working and studying</li>
<li>Varied entertainment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risks of the Internet</h2>
<p>
Although the Internet is very useful, it also has risks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Scams and fraud</li>
<li>Theft of personal data</li>
<li>Fake or dangerous content</li>
<li>Addiction due to excessive use</li>
</ul>

<h2>Responsible use of the Internet</h2>
<p>
To use the Internet safely and responsibly, it is important to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Not share personal data with strangers</li>
<li>Not trust offers that are too good to be true</li>
<li>Check the reliability of information</li>
<li>Use strong passwords</li>
<li>Respect other users</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Internet and the future</h2>
<p>
The Internet will continue to grow and change. More and more objects will be connected: cars, appliances, watches, entire cities. This will make our lives more comfortable, but it will also require greater digital responsibility.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The Internet is one of the most important tools created by humankind. When used correctly, it allows us to learn, communicate and improve our quality of life. Understanding what the Internet is and how it works is the first step to making the most of it.
